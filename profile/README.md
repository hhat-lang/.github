# H-hat project

Projects and repositories related to $\hat{H}$ ecosystem. Some developments are private until they reach enough maturity to be open-sourced and made public.

The main public repository is [H-hat language](https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang) with the language documentation being on [H-hat documentation page](https://github.com/Doomsk/hhat_lang_webpage). This is an old version of $\hat{H}$ and should be replaced for the newest in-progress version soon.

We also have [a channel](https://discord.gg/unitary-fund-764231928676089909) at the UnitaryFund discord server for the language! Join if you are interested.

This language is a (mostly) solo project and a work in progress. Development speed, documentation updates and other actions, tools and features are added when possible. If you want to engage into the project, drop a message in the channel at the UnitaryFund discord server link above.


## H-hat ecosystem

The ecosystem consists of four main components:
- The H-hat rule system
- THe H-hat programming language
- The H-hat documentation
- The H-hat tools

### H-hat rule system

This is where the core rules and behaviors for the language and its engines are defined. Any implementation of the language must follow those rules to be considered a H-hat dialect or H-hat compatible language.

### H-hat programming language

After a great time experimenting with syntaxes, paradigms and people's opinions, I realized it is not possible to please everybody (if any amount of people, really). For that reason I decided to create the H-hat rule system so different implementations, with different syntaxes and maybe even different paradigms could cohexist. Let the future should whether it was a good idea or not. So far, I think it is the best approach to at least keep testing things, redoing them, changing them and improving them without the need to rewrite everything every time. It saves a lot of time for this stage of development.

All that said, the language itself, at least as of now, is a compendium of ideas and experimentations with rules that seem to make sense for the proposal of the language (and also its purpose). There is not a definite syntax, but I will soon bring some basic vanilla versions to start playing with. As it will become clear, the rule system defines some good amount of procedures and also development practices to make the language engine work with different dialects (syntax dialects, mostly for now).

### H-hat documentation

The idea of the documentation page is not only to show the language features, tutorials, how-to's, installation, etc., but also provide a blog-like or a "biography" for the language, since its early stage (when it was not even this name given) up to the most recent developments. Also it is a place I want to share some papers, accomplishments and progress about the language and its surroundings.

### H-hat tools

And of course, it needs to have proper tools to develop it **and** develop with it. As a one-person endeavor, things will be slow but steady.

## In progress

As always, this is a work in progress. Help is always welcomed. To listen and to speak, both are important. To learn and to teach is what I expect to have from interactions.
